Binary-Search


Binary search is an algorith which only works on a sorted list.
It works by checking **mid** (does integer division of the lenght of list and assigns that to **mid**)

Depending on whether **mid** is greater or less then the **value** either **start** or **end** gets modified to become **mid** + 1 or **mid** - 1.

The check is then done again and this is done until the value is found.

If **start** becomes greater than **end** then it knows **value** is not in the list.

else if outputs the index that **value** is stored at.

This algorithm can be modified to search for multiple occurences of **value** however currently does not. Would be as simple as checking the ajacent indexs until **value** is not seen and counting the amount of these occurences.
